			<h3><strong>Data Feed & Activity Feed</strong></h3>
			<p>
				Pulse is a “social” polling platform. Pulse provides a place where users
				 can discover what other students think about topics not usually
				 discussed with a big group, including the controversial ones. As we
				 grew our user base, more and more discussions took place, sometimes
				 going on through dozens of comments on a single thread.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initially, we limited access to data other than from polls and questions
				a user already participated in. But soon, it became clear to us that
				the rich, user-generated content was reaching only those that were
				invested in checking the results.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the first-time user, it was often very hard to come across the best
				discussions and witty comments. For the discussion participators, it was
				hard to keep track of the conversations they were having just through
				push notifications. Thus, we needed to design a better way to present
				the increasing amount of user-generated data.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<!-- Ivies Launching Rebranding ============================================================================ -->

			<h3><strong>Converting Data Explorer into Data Feed</strong></h3><p/>

			<h4>Design Goals</h4>
			<p>
				To help the best content reach the most users as possible, we decided
				to create a data feed where user-generated content could be featured.
				A few key purposes of the feed were:
			</p>
			<li>Feature user-generated content to highlight active engagement from fellow users </li>
			<li>Provide content that is easier to digest than raw data </li>
			<li>Facilitate discussion and conversation of results </li>
			<p>
				One of the very first attempts we made to address the second point
				(provide content easier to digest) was through “daily cards”: a little
				section at the top of polls to show interesting insights from existing
				poll data. We discovered that the daily cards were getting a lot of
				attention and decided to extend on the idea through a data feed.
			</p>

			<h4>Iterations</h4>
			<p>
				A typical feed is created by the users “following” certain topics or
				people. This is possible for social platforms that have a lot of
				content constantly being generated by users, which is not the case with
				Pulse. Instead of a personalized feed, Pulse had to create a centralized
				hub for the best content to be featured, like a newspaper homepage.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a polling platform, Pulse has different question types (multiple
				choice, open answer etc.) that render differently according to their
				type. The data feed needed to able to encompass different kinds of
				“posts,” such as:
			</p>
			<li>Response to an open-ended question</li>
			<li>Question data as charts</li>
			<li>Comments on data charts</li>
			<li>Blog posts</li>

			<p>
				Since these “posts” are so different from each other, I first envisioned
				a dashboard-like homepage with different sections for different types.
				But this hindered the infinitely scrollable characteristic that makes
				feeds so engaging.
			</p>

			<img src="images/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard design">

			<p>
				Although the nature of the feed is a little different, I wanted to
				create a design that imitates that of popular social applications.
				After looking at multiple social media apps, I found some common
				elements that composed a “post," such as an avatar, content etc.
				Using these elements and integrating them with the existing layouts,
				I created a potential feed design.
			</p>

			<img src="images/feed_v1.png" alt="Feed v.1">

			<p>
				After the first version of the feed was launched, we could definitely
				see an increase in user engagement. But instead of actually taking the
				polls, people were answering the questions through the comments.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make sure that all possible actions are covered, I created a map of
				possible actions that could take place initiated from a feed post. Based
				on this, I tried to improve the feed using these points:
			</p>
			<div class="bulletlist">
				<li>distinguishing poll data and user-generated content</li>
				<li>clear hierarchy of comments</li>
				<li>better integration of links between posts and their polls</li>
				<li>making it more evident what will be shared</li>
			</div>

			<img src="images/feed_v2.png" alt="Improved Feed">

			<h4>Moving Forward</h4>
			<p>
				In the early days of Pulse, we created topic-based polls with multiple
				questions regarding the same topic within a poll. As we expanded and
				users demanded to see more polls every day, we started publishing polls
				with 5 top questions that were voted on, rather than organizing them by topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the points system and the poll format already in place, it was
				difficult to significantly change the main functionality of the app.
				But now that most questions are standalone and do not need to be placed
				in context, it may be possible to create a better user experience by
				implementing a question feed, providing one question at a time.
			</p>

			<h3><strong>Activity Feed</strong></h3><p/>

			<h4>Design Goals</h4>
			<p>
				To facilitate the actions of the contributors, I also designed an
				activity hub in which people could easily keep track of their activity
				and content.
			</p>
			<p>
				This feature was actually built based on common suggestions we got from
				users. Some users wanted to keep track of how many votes their question
				suggestions were getting. Some users wanted a shortcut to access lengthy
				discussions they were having on a question. Some users even suggested
				that they be able to extend those discussions through a private chat.
			</p>

			<h4>Iterations</h4>
			<p>
				Working with the existing design, the most logical place to put an
				activity feed seemed to be where notifications originally were. Pulse
				was already sending push notifications regarding the topics mentioned
				above. But the original notification designs made it hard to distinguish
				previous notifications from new notifications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using this spot meant that the new designs needed to provide a way to
				access some of features that were originally in the same spot as well.
				Thus, the activity feed needed to cover:
			</p>
			<div class="bulletlist">
				<li>Notifications</li>
				<li>Conversations/Comments (+ a new Chat feature)</li>
				<li>Suggestions in the Ask section</li>
				<li>Sign Out</li>
				<li>Report an Issue</li>
			</div>
			<p>
				I decided to break down the activity into four tabs: <strong> Notifications,
				Comments, Messages, and Suggestions </strong> (from the Ask section).
				The other less frequent features, such as signing out and reporting an
				issue, could be put into a settings menu.
			</p>

			<img src="images/notifications.png" alt="Notifications">
			<img src="images/comments.png" alt="Comments">

			<p>
				Enabling a <strong>chat</strong> feature was the most challenging part
				of this task. In order to initiate a private message, you need to have
				a target. Comments in Pulse are anonymous except with an indication of
				which campus the poster is from. How could a chat begin in such a situation?
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I realized that users would send a private message only after
				seeing an initial comment. This meant that sending a message was just
				another method of responding to a comment. By adding an option to reply
				privately, a private conversation could be initiated.
			</p>

			<p>And of course, can't forget to add a little delight to the empty states!</p>
			<img src="images/empty_states.png" alt="Empty states">
			<p>I envision the little flag next to the mailbox swiveling down once the
				user is done reading all the notifications. </p>


			<h4>Moving Forward</h4>
			<p>
				The activity feed is still in development, and I still have questions
				that have yet to be tested. Is the extent of content being covered be
				enough or excessive? Will having a chat feature catalyze or hinder discussions?
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>
				While I was designing the activity feed, I stumbled upon the idea of
				“levels” for the users. We currently have a streak system built for
				answering polls, but there is no incentive for users who pursue further
				actions. By integrating an incentive system into the feeds, Pulse may
				be able to appeal to more users.
