			<h3><strong>Kodama and the Magic Seeds</strong></h3>
			<h4>Character Designer and Writer, 2016</h4>

			<a href="http://seanoh.github.io/" target="_blank">
				<p><strong>WEBSITE</strong></p>
			</a>

			<p>
				Kodama and the Magic Seeds is a relaxing game with calming music and
				low-poly graphics. Made with Unity3D and Maya, I developed the game
				along with Sean Oh and Armin Mahban.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h4><strong>Concepts & Design</strong></h4>
			<p>
				The most important keyword of the game was “calming.” We wanted to create
				a game that can be enjoyed by everyone from first-time game players to
				intense gamers. After some meetings, we agreed that a good place to start
				would be about a magical forest, and the overall gameplay would be puzzles.
			</p>

			<h4>Story</h4>
			<div class = "kodama_story">
				<p>Kodama is a child of the forest created by the Mother Tree. He would
					talk to and take care of the flowers and animals of the forest during
					the day, and return to Mother at night to sleep peacefully on her roots.</p>
				<p>One day, Kodama returned home and noticed something was wrong. The
					luscious leaves that once covered Kodama safely at night were no longer
					on Mother’s gentle branches. Mother groaned in pain, and slowly spoke
					out to little Kodama who was staring from a distance with fear.</p>
				<p>“Kodama, my child, do not fret. I am a little sick, so I need your help.”</p>
				<p>“Tell me Mother, how can I help?”</p>
				<p>“Long ago, I placed some of my magical powers throughout the forest in
					magic seeds. These seeds of magic are hidden in special flowers that
					grow on stumps. They will only open when you gather the power of
					crystals that grow in the forest. I need you to go collect them for me,
					so I may be reborn from their powers.” </p>
				<p>“I will go right away, Mother.”</p>
				<p>“You will need to venture far and beyond the forest you know. There
					will be many challenges along the way, so please, please be safe...”</p>
				<p>That’s how Kodama began his journey to save all that he loved.</p>

			<h4>Character</h4>
			<p>After we flushed out the story, we knew that the character had to be
				somewhat connected to a forest. I knew that I wanted the character to
				be cute: other than that, I explored a bunch of ideas from animals to
				sprouts to simple blocks.</p>
			<img src="images/character_sketches.jpg" alt="Early Designs" />
			<p>The final design turned out to be a little figure with a huge acorn top
				as its hat. Some people asked me if it was a mushroom... But I guess
				it works since mushrooms and acorns are both from the forest :P</p>

			<p>I also explored a few designs for Mother Tree’s face and branch design.
				But modeling an old person’s face using low poly was not something very
				easy, so we decided to skip on that.</p>

			<h4>Magic Seed</h4>
			<p>The magic seeds and their hosting flowers were one of the most
				important designs in the game. I wanted to incorporate both the
				organic nature of forests yet add a touch of something else to emphasize
				the “magic” they held.</p>

			<h4>Game UI Elements</h4>
			<p>Main UI elements were created in Adobe Illustrator to guide the user in
				different steps along the gameplay.
				I also considered creating UI elements that look like sketches, but it
				did not go well with the low-poly look of the rest of the game.</p>

			<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>

			<div class="video">

			</div>

			<p>The game can be downloaded from the website <a href="http://seanoh.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. It’s a demo version
			with just a few levels, but it really helped us understand the basics of
			game development. As someone who loves playing games, I have so much
			respect for game designers and developers, and hope to create more games
			in the future.</p>
