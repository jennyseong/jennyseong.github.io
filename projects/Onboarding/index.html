			<h3><strong>College Pulse Onboarding Redesign</strong></h3>
			<p>Over the summer of 2018, College Pulse extended its user pool to students from any college in the United States. One of the most common “issues” that the new users reported was that they could not find the confirmation code sent to their email in the registration process. <br>
				This lead me to think of ways we could make the Pulse experience for the first-time user more friendly and easy. </p>

			<hr />

			<!-- Preface ============================================================================ -->

			<h4><strong>Revisiting the Onboarding Process</strong></h4>
			<p>I went through the existing onboarding process and noticed a few pain points: <p>
			<li>Providing too much text in the intro cards</li>
			<li>Static sign up process</li>
			<li>No guidance of what to do after the first login</li>
			<li>Very long first survey for demographic information</li>
			<li>Little guidance of what to do after a survey is finished</li>
			<p>The last point was especially important to the Pulse team: we were trying to create a platform where users can have access to the data of the polls they take, but not many users were using the data analysis tools we were providing. </p>
			<img width="70%" src="images/onboarding_sketches.jpg" alt="Onboarding Sketches" /></a>
			<p>
				By going through the whole process and figuring out points in which
				we could reframe the data we provide and nudge the user in the right way,
				we could direct the users to get a better understanding of the
				full scope of features that are offered on Pulse.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<!-- Intro Cards ============================================================================ -->

			<h4><strong>Intro Cards</strong></h4>

			<p>
				Intro cards are the first things people see when they first download
				the app. It’s like the first impression of a person, determining how
				the users will feel about continuing to use the app.
			</p>

			<p>To me, these were the characteristics of Pulse that made it different from your typical survey-taking experience: </p>
			<li>Your opinion is valued. When you answer questions, you get points which you could redeem for rewards. </li>
			<li>The data is yours. Once you answer a poll, you get access to the data from that poll. </li>
			<li>If you have a question, you can ask. Many of the questions being asked in the polls are user-generated. </li>

			<p>
				Having these characteristics of Pulse in mind, I came up with some
				sketches and turned them into illustrations with little animations.
				The animations added a few extra hours to the work, but animations add
				delight, and that delight adds to the improved first impression.
				(I tend to be a strong proponent of delight.)

		<!-- Contextual Onboarding ============================================================================ -->

		<h4><strong>Sign Up Experience</strong></h4>
		<p>
			To ensure quality of data, Pulse users have to authenticate their
			affiliation to a campus through their school email. But this step was a
			bottleneck in our onboarding process, where the user couldn’t find the
			authentication code. Most of the time, the problem was as simple as
			checking for the email in your spam/junk folder. <br>

			Along with clear guidance in the authentication page, the overall sign up
			flow was broken down into one step at a time.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<h4><strong>Contextual Onboarding</strong></h4>
		<p>
			There are mainly three kinds of Pulse users: ones who come for the data
			and discussion, ones who complete surveys to get rewards, and the ones
			who engage in a little bit of everything. The problem was that these
			features—data exploring, discussion, and rewards—were not being
			highlighted in the first few minutes of using Pulse.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rather than giving a tutorial of all features at once, we nudge the user
			in a certain direction in their first few steps in Pulse.
		</p>
		<img src="images/overlays.png" alt="Overlay" /></a>

		<p>
			To further highlight that the data is available to the users, we decided
			to show the data immediately after someone selects an answer option. In
			the case in which there are a lot of answer options, the discussion
			section could only be accessed through lots of scrolling. I was important
			to make discussions more accessible and easily show when a question is
			especially popular.
		</p>
		<img src="images/immediate_data.png" alt="Immediate Data" /></a>

		<hr />

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>Some of these designs have yet to be implemented to the actual
			application. But immediately after the overlays were added, the
			percentage of users starting to input their demographics rose from
			65% to <strong>91%</strong>. The percentage of users finishing their first survey
			after the demographics also increased from 55% to <strong>78%</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, instead of showing the most recent survey, we used a hot sort to
			make the first-time users take one regarding a heated topic, such as gun
			control, to pique their interest and show that there is a lot of
			discussion happening among the users. This lead the percentage of people
			finishing a second poll from 30% to <strong>51%</strong>.
